Consider transformations that are non-decreasing (if x is greater than or equal to x prime, then g(x) is greater than or equal to g(x prime)), like 2 + 5 times X or arcsinh(X). Is a non-decreasing transformation of the median the median of the transformed variable? Explain. Does your answer apply to any quantile? The Interquartile Range? The range?\n",
        "\n",
        "Is a non-decreasing transformation of the median the median of the transformed variable? Yes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: Let m be the median of X. This means half the values of X are less than or equal to m, and half are greater than or equal to m. Since g(x) is a non-decreasing function, if x sub i is less than or equal to m, then g(x sub i) is less than or equal to g(m). Similarly, if x sub i is greater than or equal to m, then g(x sub i) is greater than or equal to g(m). Therefore, half the values of g(X) will be less than or equal to g(m), and half will be greater than or equal to g(m), making g(m) the median of g(X).\n",
        "Does your answer apply to any quantile? Yes, it applies to any quantile. The logic is the same as for the median. If g(x) is non-decreasing, then the p-th quantile of g(X) is g(q sub p), where q sub p is the p-th quantile of X.\n",
        "The Interquartile Range? Yes, the property holds for the Interquartile Range. The Interquartile Range is Q3 minus Q1. Since the quantiles are preserved through a non-decreasing transformation, the Interquartile Range of the transformed variable will be g(Q3) minus g(Q1).\n",
        "The range? No, the property does not necessarily hold for the range. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. While the minimum and maximum values of X will transform to the minimum and maximum values of g(X) (because g is non-decreasing), the difference between the transformed values will not necessarily equal g(the range of X).\n",

        "\n",
        "No, it is not always true that the mean of the transformed variable is the transformation of the mean.\n",
        "The mean is a linear operator (as shown in problem 1), but in general, it does not commute with non-linear functions. Jensen's inequality tells us something about this relationship for convex or concave functions, but in general, for a non-decreasing function, you cannot assume that the mean of g(X) equals g(the mean of X).\n",
        "Counterexample: Let X take on values 1, 2, and 3 with equal probability (1/3). Then the mean of X is (1+2+3)/3 = 2. Let g(x) = x squared. Then g(X) takes on values 1, 4, and 9. Thus, the mean of g(X) is (1+4+9)/3 = 14/3 â‰ˆ 4.67. However, g(the mean of X) = g(2) = 2 squared = 4. Therefore, the mean of g(X) does not equal g(the mean of X)."
